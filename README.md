# About Me 
Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Kyle. I work in finance, but I'm trying to automate myself out of a job.

## My Interests
I love learning technical skills, figuring out how things work, and studying lanugages. Pointless passion projects are my thing. 

I enjoy traveling, and have been to (_almost_) every contiguous state. I have nothing against Vermont, I just haven't made it out there yet.

Occasionally, I lift. 

## Great Sites
- [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/) - Contains flowcharts detailing role-based and skill-based curricula for programming and computer science; everything from Python and React to Software Architecture and Cyber Security.  
- [Math Academy](www.mathacademy.com) - Hands down _**the quickest**_ way to brush up on math. Their approach is backed by a huge amount of pedagogical research. If you want to become competent in math, this is an excellent resource to leverage.
